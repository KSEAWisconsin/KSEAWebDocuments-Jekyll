# Docusaurus
Reference: [Docusaurus in Github](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/master/README.md)

## Basic Description
- Project for easily building, deploying, and maintaining **open source** project website
- Using Node.JS
- Based on React.JS (Front-end Framework developed by Facebook)
- [Official site](https://docusaurus.io/)

## Feautures
- Open source
- Simple to Start
  - Docusaurus is built to be easy to [get up and running](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html) in as little time possible.
  - We've built Docusaurus to handle the website build process so you can focus on your project.
- Localizable
  - Docusaurus ships with [localization support](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/translation.html) via CrowdIn. Empower and grow your international community by translating your documentation.
- Customizable
  - While Docusaurus ships with the key pages and sections you need to get started, including a home page, a docs section, a [blog](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/blog.html), and additional support pages.
  - it is also [customizable](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/custom-pages.html) as well to ensure you have a site that is [uniquely yours](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/api-pages.html).

## Reason for Choosing Docursaurus
- Open Source
- Self Hosted
- Support Document Versioning
  - Other framework can also achieve versioning of documents by saving source code (or build result) on github

## Reason for Refusing Docursaurus
- Seems like the software is about to go through the major version upgrade
  - Maybe problomatic when we trying to upgrade later
  - We do not have time to wait what is going on for Version 2, which may be preferred
- Lack of users, hard to find useful trouble shooting materials

### Facebook is also using
- Expected to grow fast
- Maybe the reason why they primarily support React
