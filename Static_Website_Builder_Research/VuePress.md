## Reason for Choosing VuePress
- For someone who have previous experience on Vue.js, and big fan of it, VuePress (and Nuxt) can be an ideal selection for them

- Cannot find enough **documentation** (Both in Korean and English)
  - Due to lack of users actively using this tool
  - We do not have time to go through everything
