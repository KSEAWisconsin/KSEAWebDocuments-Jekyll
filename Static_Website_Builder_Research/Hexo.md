## Basic Description
- A fast, simple & powerful blog framework, powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Static site generator
- [Official site](https://hexo.io/): described how to install and so on

## Feautures
- Support for GitHub Flavored Markdown and most **Octopress** plugins
- Plugin system
  - for **Jade**
  - for **CoffeeScript**
- Blazing fast
  - **Node.js** brings you incredible generating speed. Hundreds of files take only seconds to build.


## Reason for Choosing Hexo
- Ease of deployment
- Easy **GitHub Pages publishing**
  - Same for the other Static Website Builders, and **Jekyll** is much better on doing this.

## Reason for Refusing Hexo
- Backbone of software has been built with Node.JS, but other useful tools (plug-ins) are built in Jade and CoffeeScript, which are different
  - Need to study more to fully understand and use this tool
  - steep learning-curve
- Having large community, but majority of those are Chinese
  - Is there anyone who can speek Chinese in our team...?
