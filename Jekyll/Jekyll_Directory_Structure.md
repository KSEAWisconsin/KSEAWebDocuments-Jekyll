### Basic Descriptions
- [Liquid Layout Demo](https://codepen.io/nickpettit/full/htviL)
- A template engine which was written with very specific requirements
- Uses relative units instead of fixed units.
  - Fill the width of the page by percentages instead of pixels.
  - But that doesn't mean it will not work with such as ems.
  

### Features
- Allow the users to edit the appearance of your application but don't let them to run **insecure code on your server**.
- Render templates direct
- PHP style
- Use template engine which does HTML just as well as emails.


# Front Matter
[Official Site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/03-front-matter/)

To use the font matter, we need to refer this:

```
---
title: Home
---
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ "Hello World!" | downcase }}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Looks like more complicate than HTML, but it is highly related with **Layout**.
